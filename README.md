# NeuralNetworks

Neural networks I programmed while watching 'Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks'

NN - Neural Network

AE - Auto Encoder

ANN - Artifical Neural Network

CNN - Convolutional Neural Network

RBM - Restriced Boltzmann Machines

RNN - Recurrent Neural Network

SOM - Self Organiznig Maps

All datasets required to run particular NN are in its folder except CNN where you need to create set of cats and dogs pictures.
folder hierarchy should look like this:

data/training_set/cats/cat.1.jpg...cat.n.jpg
                 /dogs/dog.1.jpg...dog.n.jpg
    
    /test_set/cats/cat.n+1.jpg...cat.m.jpg
             /dogs/dog.n+1.jpg...dog.m.jpg
